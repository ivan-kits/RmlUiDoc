The event system is based on the extremely flexible DOM event system. When an event is fired at a target element, it **captures** from the root to the target and then **bubbles** back up to the root. Event listeners can be attached in either capture or bubble phase. Binding done in RML will always attach to the bubble phase.

Some events do not execute the bubble phase. For additional details, see the [C++ events documentation](../cpp_manual/events.html).

### RML binding

Event listeners can be bound to an element declared in RML by specifying an attribute with the name of the event to bind to prefixed with `on`{:.attr}. For example, to bind a listener to the `click`{:.evt} event, you would declare something like the following:

```html
<button onclick="load game">Start Game</button>
```

Note that this is the only time you prefix the event name with `on`{:.attr}; all other times an event is referenced, it is done so simply with its name.

### Events

Below is a list of events and their associated event attributes.

A number of input events send through key modifiers. In this case the following parameters are set to true if the key modifier is active when the action takes place:

* ctrl_key
* shift_key
* meta_key
* alt_key
* caps_lock_key
* num_lock_key
* scroll_lock_key 

#### General Events

#### Keyboard Events

`keydown`{:.evt}
: Sent to the focus element when a key is pressed.
* `key_identifier`: A value from the `Rml::Input::KeyIdentifier` enumeration (found in `<RmlUi/Core/Input.h>`{:.incl}).

`keyup`{:.evt}
: Sent to the focus element when a key is released.
* `key_identifier`: A value from the `Rml::Input::KeyIdentifier` enumeration.

* `text`: An `Rml::String` of characters encoded in UTF-8.

#### Mouse Events

All mouse events send through key modifiers.

* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context.
* `button`: The mouse button number that was clicked. 

`dblclick`{:.evt}
: Sent to the element under the mouse cursor when a mouse button is double clicked. Note that the `click`{:.attr} event will always be sent before `dblclick`{:.evt}.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context.
* `button`: The mouse button number that was clicked. 

`mouseover`{:.evt}
: Sent to an element as the mouse cursor moves onto it.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context. 

`mouseout`{:.evt}
: Sent to an element as the mouse cursor moves off it.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context. 

`mousemove`{:.evt}
: Sent to the element under the mouse cursor when the mouse is moved.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context. 

`mouseup`{:.evt}
: Sent to the element under the mouse cursor when a mouse button is released.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context.

* `button`: The mouse button number that was pressed. 

`mousescroll`{:.evt}
: Sent to the focus element when the mouse's scroll wheel is scrolled, or [autoscroll mode](../cpp_manual/contexts.html#autoscroll) is being initiated. The scroll can be cancelled by stopping the event's propagation.
* `mouse_x`: The mouse x position within the context.
* `mouse_y`: The mouse y position within the context.
* `wheel_delta_x`: The distance the wheel has been scrolled horizontally, as a float value with positive values to the right.
* `wheel_delta_y`: The distance the wheel has been scrolled vertically, as a float value with positive values down.
